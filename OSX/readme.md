Before you can run this script on OSX:

1. `chmod 755 flash.sh`
2. `chmod 755 getId.sh`

After that you can run the scripts `./flash.sh` or `./getId.sh`

Both scripts will check the following things
- if you have installed the Arduino IDE
- if you have installed ESPtools
- if you have an ESP (nodeMCU) connected to your computer
